# Crash_Landing
Game: Try and land your spaceship before you run out of fuel!

Control your spaceship with the arrow keys. However, you can only control the acceleration, not direct movement! Accelerating uses fuel, and you only have a finite amount. 

The aim is to land on the planet, but if you come in too fast you will crash. If you fall into the sun, you will crash. If you run out of fuel you will spin off into space forever.
